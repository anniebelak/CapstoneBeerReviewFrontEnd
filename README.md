                            WHaTs HOPs ining

WHaTs HOPs ining is designed for the beer connoiseur, it allows a user to review different beers from local
breweries so that when visiting your with friends or family you can remember and share what beers you have had and
and what you liked. The user can sign into application and start reviewing beers from local breweries right away!

In future iterations, the plan is to add the following:

-Create an administrator profile that would allow breweries and beers to be
added to the database.

-Allow for users to share their reviews with eachother.

User Guide
1. User must sign up and sign in to review beers.

2.Once signed in to WHaTs HOPS ining a user can select a Local Breweries to see list
of local breweries and the beers to review.

3. Once in the list of Local Breweries , beers can be selected and a review
can be created.

4. Reviews can be viewed, edited and deleted by going to My Reviews.

Technologies Used:

1.HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, Bootstrap

2.GIT for code repository

3.Trello to track work

4. Ruby on Rails to Build Backend.

Developement Process
The first few steps in developement wireframes and user stories were created to
to outline how app should look and respond to user.

An ERD was also created to understand how the database should be set up in relationship
to the purpose of the app.

Throughout the initial stages of the development process the wireframes and ERD were revised.
The scope of the project went from allowing users to be able to not only create reviews on beers,
but to also be able to add beers and locations. For version 1.0 of WhaTs HOPS ining the app
is focused on delivering the first feature of allowing users to be able to create reviews, edit and
delete reviews from a list of breweries and beers. The data for the local breweries and beers has been
seeded and is a small selection for this version as well. This was my first expierence using Rails with
join tables and foreign keys in an application, the set up of the database was clear however I did have challenges
knowing how to poplate the data needed on the front end but worked through these challenges with trail and error and leaning
on my past project and class expierences.
